# My  Portfolio
This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for my data science portfolio hosted on GithubPages. The website showcases my skills and experience in data science, including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization.


# Projects
Forecasting self-recovery among delinquent customers
In this project, I utilized a decision tree algorithm to anticipate self-cure among delinquent customers, which in turn helps to decrease operational expenses.

Predicting House Prices using Machine Learning Techniques
This project involved applying various machine learning techniques to predict house prices. The end-to-end machine learning project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, I used decision trees and random forests to model the data and make predictions.
