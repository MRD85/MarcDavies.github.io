      <h2>Data Scientist <s>in Training</s> with Extensive SQL Experience</h2>
      <p>With 15 years experience in financial services, 10 in data and analysis, I am currently training to become a data scientist with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Below are some of the <b>Data Science and Machine Learning</b> projects I have worked on:</p>

          <h4 class="project-title">Forecasting self-recovery among delinquent customers to reduce operational expenses</h4>
          <p class="project-description">In this project, I utilised a decision tree algorithm to anticipate self-cure among delinquent customers, which in turn helps to decrease operational expenses. The results of the project exhibited promising outcomes, and the algorithm was able to predict the self-recovery among delinquent customers with great accuracy. The use of this model can assist in reducing operational expenses and aid in predicting potential issues that may arise with customers.</p>

          <h4 class="project-title">Predicting House Prices using Machine Learning Techniques: A Comprehensive End-to-End Project</h4>
          <div class="project-description-container">
            <p>Looking to bridge the gap in my technical ability and Python experience, I turned to a project in which I applied various machine learning techniques to predict house prices.</p>
            <p>The end-to-end machine learning project involved:</p>
            <ul class="project-steps" style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li>Data preprocessing</li>
              <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
              <li>Feature engineering</li>
              <li>Model selection</li>
              <li>Hyperparameter tuning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For this project, I utilised decision trees and random forests to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. To ensure that the models were accurate and could be applied to new data, I evaluated them using mean squared error and cross-validation techniques. The results showed that the random forest model outperformed the decision tree model and was selected to make predictions on new data.</p>
