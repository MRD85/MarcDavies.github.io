        <h2>Emerging Data Scientist with Python and Extensive SQL Experience. #SQL #Python #MachineLearning #DataAnalysis</h2>

        <p>With 15 years of experience in financial services, 10 in data and analysis, 
          I am currently training to become a data scientist with a focus on machine 
          learning and artificial intelligence. Below are some of the <strong>Data 
            Science and Machine Learning </strong>projects I have worked on:</p>

        The goal was to identify customers who would pay regardless of attempted collections calls and save resources.
        The project is now on the roadmap for delivery in 2023, thanks to collaboration with the Decision Science team.
        I initially attempted decision trees before moving onto XGBoost, as I learned that decision trees partition data into subsets based on feature values, while XGBoost uses decision trees and boosting techniques, therefore providing more accurate predictions.</p>

      <div class="project-description-container">
        <p>Looking to bridge the gap in my technical ability and Python experience, after being recommended 
          <B>O'Reilly's Hand's On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow</B>, I turned to a project
           in which I applied various machine learning techniques to predict house prices. </p>
        <p>The end-to-end machine learning project involved:</p>
        <ul class="project-steps" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>Data preprocessing</li>
          <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
          <li>Feature engineering</li>
          <li>Model selection</li>
          <li>Hyperparameter tuning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this project, I utilised decision trees and random forests to predict house prices using machine 
          learning techniques. I learned multiple elements of the ML process, best practices as well as how to 
          ensure that the models were accurate and could be applied to new data, I evaluated them using mean squared 
          error and cross-validation techniques. The results showed that the random forest model outperformed the 
          decision tree model and was selected to make predictions on new data.</p>

      <div style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 300px; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 5px;">

      <div class="project-description-container">
        <p>While this isn't strictly ML, it's still worth mentioning as part of my journey to become a data scientist. 
          I worked on a project to optimise call center dialler operations by analysing RPC performance of different 
          segments based on various features. While many were considered, including credit bureau and multiple internal 
          data points, when it came to RPC by hour of the day, age and gender had the biggest impact. People at similar life 
          stages are more likely to have similar routines, such as the elderly being available
          early morning, compared to young parents who are likely unavailable during school runs.</p>
        <p>The project involved the following steps:</p>
        <ul class="project-steps" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>Data collection and preprocessing</li>
          <li>Feature engineering and selection</li>
          <li>segmentation Performance analysis</li>
          <li>Implementation involved predicting staff availability, and distribution based on segment performance for each hour </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results of this project showed that the "model" was able to accurately predict the RPC rate by age
           and gender group for each hour of the day, thus enabling the call center to optimise its dialling 
           operations and increase customer contact rates.  </p>

          <p>An FTE management portal built using Python and Tkinter.

          <p>This project involved searching for 16-digit credit card numbers in SQL databases using Python. Certain tables are excluded, and the results are inserted into a designated table. The script uses the Python modules pyodbc and concurrent.futures to connect to the databases and perform the search concurrently. Any errors encountered are caught and inserted into the designated table, along with the status of the operation and the error message. The script outputs a message for each database searched and prints any errors encountered.</p>

                <p>For Cancun Adventures Mexico, I developed an end-to-end solution using HTML, PHP, and MariaDB. The business owners wanted a way to build a mailing list for future expos and site openings by tempting customers with offers of the recipes they had enjoyed that evening.</p>
                <p>To achieve this, I built an online form that clients can fill out which is integrated with a database to store the submitted data. Once submitted, an automated HTML email is sent with a link to a menu-style webpage which has downloadable PDFs of the recipes. </p>
                <p>To streamline data management, I developed a portal for the business owners to access and download mailing lists based on their search criteria. This solution simplifies the process for clients and improves the efficiency of data management for the business owners.</p>
