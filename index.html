      </div>
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> The project aimed to reduce recovery costs by identifying delinquent customers who would pay regardless of attempted collections calls.<br>
        <strong>Action:</strong> The project initially attempted decision trees and then moved onto XGBoost modelling technique to predict self-cure customers. The decision tree technique partitions data into subsets based on feature values while XGBoost uses decision trees and boosting techniques to provide more accurate predictions.<br>
        <strong>Success:</strong> The project was successful and is now on the roadmap for delivery in 2023, thanks to collaboration with the current employer's Data Science team.<br>
        <strong>Modelling technique:</strong> The project utilized decision trees and XGBoost modelling techniques. The project was implemented using Python, scikit-learn, and MySQL.

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The project aimed to improve right-party contact rates in a call center by identifying the best time to dial using SQL and segmentation analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> The project utilized SQL and segmentation analysis techniques to analyze performance based on different features and discover age and gender had the most significant impact. Collaborating with call center managers, findings and recommendations were presented to cross-functional forums. The final solution was implemented using SQL, and performance was monitored.</p>
        <p><strong>Success:</strong> The project successfully optimized call center performance by identifying the best time to dial and implementing the recommended changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> This project didn't require a complex machine learning solution, but involved data analysis and segmentation techniques. The project was implemented using MSSQL stored procedures.</p>
